Part One: Solidify Terminology

1. What is HTTP? It is one protocol (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) for making requests to and from a server over the web.

2. What is a URL? A Uniform Resource Locator is an online/web address for any given resource.

3. What is DNS? A Domain Name System takes a URL and turns it into an IP address.

4. What is a query string? Part of a URL that allows you to pass key/value pairs.

5. List two HTTP verbs and their use cases. GET which makes requests from a server with no changes being made to content on that server. POST,
    which makes requests to the server and carries a payload. This generally leads to some change on the server.
    
6. What is an HTTP Request? A request to a server that follows HTTP protocol.

7. What is an HTTP Response? A response from a server that follows HTTP protocol.

8. What is an HTTP Header? Headers provide additional infomration about the request or response. Types include Host, Accept, Content-Type, etc.

9. What happens when you type a URL into a browser? The browser turns the name into an IP address using DNS and makes a request to that IP address, 
    including headers. The server sends a response with one of several response codes (200, 301, 404, etc). The browser makes a DOM from that HTML, 
    and finds any other resources needed (images, CSS, JavaScript, etc). The browser makes separate HTTP requests for those resources and receives 
    response from the server for each.
